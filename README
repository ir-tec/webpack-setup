## Features

- Webpack for bundling and optimizing your code.
- Babel for transpiling JavaScript and TypeScript.
- React for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript support for static typing.
- Sass loader for processing styles.
- A development server with hot module replacement.
- Production-ready builds with code splitting and minification.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ir-tec/webpack-setup.git
   ```

2. Change your working directory to the project folder.

   ```bash
   cd webpack-setup
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies.

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server and begin working on your project, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server, and you can access your application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

To create a production build of your project, use:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized and minified files in the `dist` folder.
